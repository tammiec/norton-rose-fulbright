# Norton Rose Fulbright Assessment

This is a partial implementation of the bonus portion of the Norton Rose Fulbright Assessment. It includes a basic database and server setup, with routes to create a new startup (or update it if it already exists), and routes to create/update/delete products. 

The idea is to eventually set up a client-side implementation using React (client folder created via create-react-app) as an alternative to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation already completed on the no-code platform.
